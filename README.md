### Milhouse Engineering and Construction

Milhouse Engineering and Construction, Inc. was founded in 2001 with the goal of building the best engineering company in Chicago and the country. We knew if we hired great people, fueled their passion while challenging them to excel, and maintained a laser focus on the needs of our clients, success would comeâ€”and so it has.

The Milhouse family of companies has since grown to over 500 team members across 11 offices and three countries. We are proud to have made a positive impact on millions of people across the globe.
